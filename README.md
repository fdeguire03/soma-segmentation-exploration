Files in caiman and suite2p subdirectories were used for figuring out how the algorithms work. Once results are generated, the compare_masks.ipynb file is used most heavily to load in and compare results. Most common usage (so far) is to generate results using the pipeline-timing-new-segmentation.ipynb notebook in the pipeline-timing repository and then analyze results using compare_masks.ipynb
